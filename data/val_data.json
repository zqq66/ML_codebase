[{"text": "susan granger's review of \" america's sweethearts \" ( columbia/sony ) \nwhat a waste of a talented cast ! \nbilly crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . \nthe story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . \nhe figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . \n ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) \nfor help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . \nbut the laughs are few and far-between . \ncrystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . \nafter six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . \nzeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . \nonly hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . \nbasically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" america's sweethearts \" is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial . \n", "category":

prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over . \nhopeful still ? \nwell , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , \" what do you think of my butterfly ? \" . \nbutterfly ? , \ni asked myself , what butterfly ? ! \nand then it hit me . . . \nthe scene had been snipped ! \ndamn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! \nwe want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! \nso . . . \nno naked teri hatcher . \nforget about that . \nokay ? \nnow . . . \nheaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . \neverything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat . \nthe plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . \nwhat they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues . \nwhen robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get . \nthe question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . \nas dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . \nno seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene . \nhe's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression . \nthree-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself . \non the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character . \neric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box . \nand lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's \" adventures of lois & clark \" . . . \nshe is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days off . \nit's probably safe to say that her day job beckons . \nand at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery . \nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \ntake the professional , for example . \nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along

he waits for elizabeth . \nbut elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . \nas a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . \nwhile with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . \nhis boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . \nbut soon the pillow

that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . \nbut don't get me wrong . . . \ni hope the film does do well . \nit's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . \ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . \nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . \nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city . \nfull of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . \nbut don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell . \nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . \nchris \" christy \" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . \nannie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . \nannie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . \nchris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . \nthey also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . \nbut one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . \nshe tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . \nchris copes with the problem by realizing they

, is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . \nusually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . \nbut what dreams may come goes a different route . \nit shows

of being . \nin one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his \" tracker \" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . \nthousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else .

universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . \nwriter ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . \nthe story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . \nand director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . \nwhat dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . \nyour average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques . \nthe film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far . \nit is , after all , just a movie . \nrobin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . \nhis comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective . \nbut drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . \nit's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did . \nthe real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . \nthis may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . \nit's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . \nhowever , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films . \ncuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he's certainly not distracting . \nmax von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . \na treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris' father lost in the sea of faces . \nit's not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . \noverall , it's williams and sciorra's film . \nwhat dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . \nthe film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . \nsome will find the plot distracting . \nsome will find the visuals absolutely glorious . \nand some will find both . \nthe only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . \nby the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( \" what \" becomes \" wet

ordinary speech . \nwhether it's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious

"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . \ndirected by william malone , written by dick beebe , \n \" house on haunted hill \" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . \none doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . \na nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . \nthese mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . \nexcept this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . \nin past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . \n \" house on haunted hill \" doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . \nthis nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . \n \" house on haunted hill \" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . \nthe film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . \nthe aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . \nhowever , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . \nthe plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . \neach character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . \nsince the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . \nthe problem is that every character is not likable . \nthe two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . \nthe characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . \nthe worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett . \nhe spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . \nwaiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . \nthe most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . \nplaying the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . \nhowever , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . \nthe main problem is that \" house on haunted hill \" is not scary . \nto top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . \nif the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to \" deep blue sea \" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel . \nbeloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . \nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . \ntoy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . \nas someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . \nfortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . \nlucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . \n ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood . ) \nvisually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . \nfortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . \nas before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence . \nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner . \none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . \nmost often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging . \nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie . \nsheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . \nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . \nthose anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . \nand there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . \nthe rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . \nthat this film manages to turn a box marked \" 25 cents \" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . \noperating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . \n ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) \nsometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . \nthere's somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . \nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . \n ( just don't ask why andy's favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) \nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al's toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? \nforget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . \nhere , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . \nin sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . \nsignificantly , the film's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . \nand toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . \nso toy story 2 joins the tradition of children's stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . \nwhat's really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar's a bug's life ) are kids' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . \nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . \ni'm not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next . \n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by john lasseter , colin brady , ash brannon , and lee unkrich written by lasseter , brannon , peter docter ,

surprising sweetness in the end . \namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa

is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \ni loved the young cast in this movie . \nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \nbut i never used baked goods . ' \nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway .

-- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . \neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . \nstart off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . \nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . \nworse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . \nmeant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . \ninfluential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . \" lucky 7 \" ( max

russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons . \ninstead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes . \nwhich brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said . \nmariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . \nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene . \nbut you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse . \nso much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . \neven the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly . \nthey're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , \" billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , \" and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , \" oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . \" \neveryone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . \nto say more would be a waste . \nthere's so much wrong with this film . \nand , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get . \nbut , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "there is nothing like american history x in theaters

directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible . \none of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's \" mad about you \" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "sometimes i find 19th

almost fits the story line of a film noir . \na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . \ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . \ni wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . \nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . \nroache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence

as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . \ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense

late husband . \nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \nthough it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \nthis film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \nhis performance is very chilling . \n8 mm's success may hardly be surprising . \nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes . \n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \nwelles is searching for answers . \nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \nhe just enjoys it . \nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \nhe discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim's mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \nthis is a graphic ,

easy one . \ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are

for a musical to succeed . \nsecondly , a lack of talent . \nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \nif audiences

81-minute running time . \nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \ncome to think of

favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best . \nanother drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \nwatching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver ,

books and on film for many , many years . \nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \nit's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \nthe film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future . \nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \nwhen annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \nblanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999's \" boys don't cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000's \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000's \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda . \nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating . \nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . \nit may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . \n",

hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren't

it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on ,

summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . \nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \nyou honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \nyou'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . \nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \nplaying sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989's \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "meet joe

rest . \nthe question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? \nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \nyou think to yourself : \" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998's \" hurlyburly \" or 1994's \" when a man loves a woman \" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \nwith \" hanging up , \" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan's senior . \nyeah , right . \nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999's \" analyze this . \" \nkudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . \nif anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998's \" the opposite of sex . \" \nif you are a fan of kudrow's ( and who isn't ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than \" hanging up \" does in its entirety . \nas eve's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . \ncloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . \nnearly all the emotions displayed within \" hanging up \" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? \nif , for some bizarre , \" twilight zone \" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over . \nsaying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the

series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only \" bram stoker's dracula \" and \" mary shelley's frankenstein . \" \ncoppola is an executive producer for \" sleepy hollow , \" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of \" moving pictures , \" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . \n ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . \nwhen the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) \nbottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy . \n", "category": "neg"},

after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a

. \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make

is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . \nthey're not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture . \ni still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . \nand i think that lumet's \" 12 angry men \" , wilder's \" witness for the prosecution \" and kubrick's \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . \nbut i can't deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river kwai \" - cinematically and in its contents . \nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \na bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . \nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .

the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \nand the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in \" paths of glory \" . \nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . \nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \nthat means , the picture isn't perfect . \nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \nit shows the \" madness \" of war and what war can produce in people's minds . \nit shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \nand \" the bridge on the river kwai \" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \ndavid lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . \nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \nthe other actors deliver very good performances as well . \njack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . \ni

event of the summer is here \" and that's the problem . \nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \nit's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \nit wasn't always this way . \ntim burton's \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . \nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . \nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . \n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . \nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \n \" batman and robin \" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \nit's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \neasily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . \nthe film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . \nas for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . \ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \nthurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \ni don't think so . \nmy prescription ? \nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . \ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . \ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman .

undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet

into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection

to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in

ending and had another director reshoot it . \nwhat a crock . \nif you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . \nwhy film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending . \nyou're fired . \nlet's get someone else to do it . \n- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . \nthe end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . \nwhich is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . \nin this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money . \ni miss originality in film , i really do . \ni think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . \npayback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . \nwhile gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman . \nthere's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life . \nand gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a \" bad guy \" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . \nthe story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 . \ngibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less . \nhe makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand . \na real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest . \nthis idea is completely stretched out . \ngibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . \nwhat i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia . \n$70 , 000 is like spare change to them . \nthey'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . \ni think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 . \nmaybe i'm being too hard on the movie . \nperhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . \ni read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . \nthat's why we're allowed to root for him . \nand it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard . \nbut he's wrong here . \ni wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker . \nas a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . \nafter this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? \nreally , i don't care . \ni'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it's fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right \" . \na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . \nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh \" . \nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \nit seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \nthese flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \nit's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \nit's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \nthe film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) . \ni won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \nsad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \nnow that would be scary . \nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with . \nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \nas boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \nwholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question . \nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \nit's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film . \nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \nwhile much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \nit's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \nafter the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs . \nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \njack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's \" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! \" \nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i've ever done \" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges . \nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \nstill , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \nin any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \nif this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing \" i'm so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \ni'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \nconsequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \ndraw your own conclusions . \nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \nluis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \njack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs . \nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "it's time to take cover . \nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \nof the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \nsymbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that . \nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \nharry survived , but his wife did not . \na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \nalthough the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \nthey are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak . \nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \nthis film contains a number of cliches . \nthe amorous couple is one . \nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die . \nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \nfor example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm . \nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . \" \neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked . \n \" is that your recipe for frog soup ? \" \nasks one of the team members . \n \" it's my recipe for disaster , \" responds harry . \ndante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \nthanks for the tip . \nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such . \nthis wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , \" u . s . geological survey . \" \ni suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs . \nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \nwere they even attracted to each other ? \" \nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \nwho does he think he is ? \njames bond ? \nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \nthere are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything . \nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \na tremor occurs . \ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \nit wasn't . \none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak . \nin a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \nit's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \nif you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \nin dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough . \nmaybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \nthe first is the scenery . \nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \nthe second is the special effects . \nthey are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \nbut when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": " * * * the following review contains some harsh

sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b . harmon written and directed by : jeff b . harmon running time : 97 minutes \n \" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside . \" \n--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . \nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . \nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . \ninstead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . \napril loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . \nin actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special \" treatment \" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . \nwhen april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . \ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . \n ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) \napril's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \ni'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent . \nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get . \ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \ni'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \nagain , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain't ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \n \" i'm a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \nit's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \nwait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . . \noh , never mind . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "it's hard not to recommend \" the others . \" \nthe supernatural thriller , written and directed by

. \noverall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old \" twilight zone \" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . \nwatching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always

scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . \nthe visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . \ni also

of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \nthe story of serendipity is simple . \ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have

man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . \nbut truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . \nnot all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . \nthere is no plot anywhere , and the \" dialogue \" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . \nthey set up mr . freeze as a

enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . \nbut that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines . \nas mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . \nthis is the same problem he had in \" jingle all the way \" , and it

understandable . \ncompare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in \" batman & robin \" . \napparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . \numa thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . \nher poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . \nand her pamela isley

alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . \nin fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . \nunfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . \nthe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . \nthere's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . \nthe only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . \neven then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that

to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . \ni know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice . \nthat's all traditional comic book stuff . \nbut why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? \nwhy is there a big switch clearly marked , \" heat \" in mr . freeze's lair ? \nwhy do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? \nwhy does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? \nwhy do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? \nand since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ? \ni could go on and on .

performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . \nmy only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . \ni really wanted to know , and my need to

sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . \nfollowing her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \ncynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . \nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , \" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? \nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \nhence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \nat the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \nmaurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \nbut she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . \nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \nthe film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \nhowever , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . \nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a

cold . \nlittle known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . \nmost of his ideas are fresh and at the same time

mildew-like spot on the wall . \ntaguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . \npeople whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . \nbut

they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . \nthe computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . \nthis is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing \" like a computer disk . \" \ninstead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . \nthere is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . \nleave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . \nthis is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . \nit may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . \nkurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . \nfrequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . \nhis plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . \njunichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . \nimages are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . \nscenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . \npeople are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . \nseeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . \nkurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . \nof any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . \ni rate this metaphysical look at

wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \nthe world is not enough is no exception . \nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \nhow about the cast ? \nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \nthen there are the bond girls . \nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \nthen we have denise richards . \nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \nso how does it stack up ? \ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the

bridget fonda ) . \nalso entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . \nthe big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . \nit's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . \nthere are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . \nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . \nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . \na 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? \nyou've got to commend the acting . \njackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . \nthe film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . \ntarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . \nalso , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . \njackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . \nyou can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . \nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together . \ngrier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . \nin fact , she's flat-out great . \nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . \nmichael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . \nspeaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . \nthere's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . \nwhich is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . \nthe story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . \nbut oh well . \njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . \nlet's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us . \n",

running time . \nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \nthrough edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as

true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \nthe film opens

and rednecks . \nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . \nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael

director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \nand not a particularly good one at that . \nwhat went wrong ? \nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool . \nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \nwhy ? \ni haven't the foggiest . \ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \nit's possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \nthe scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \ngod forbid . \nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \nsure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \ncruise grins a little too slyly . \nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \nhe's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) . \nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial \" i'm the man ! \" \ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop . \nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \nwe've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \nit isn't done any differently here . \nthe action is pure hard target \\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \nhe's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie . \nthe actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \nwhen he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort . \nhe fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers . \nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . \nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \nwhat a hero ! \nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot . \nmy reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do . \nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \ni wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it . \nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \nit's irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \n",

another . \none of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer

many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \nthis is a definite plus . \nhere's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people . \nbut this film doesn't let that happen . \nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \nhe's dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \nthe film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \nit's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \nthe studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \nsome people say that a film does its job

{"text": "notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . \nthe movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . \nand it apparently worked . \nperhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . \nallow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . \ngrant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . \ninto his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . \na common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . \ndays later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . \n ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) \nonly anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . \nrichard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's \" beauty and the beast \" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . \nas with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . \ncurtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family . \nby now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate . \nyes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . \nin the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . \nthe scene ends only as a british writer would end it . \nif anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact . \nroberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely . \n ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous \" i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her \" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) \nnotting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number . \nif only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . \nit really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it . \nhowever , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . \ni didn't get a chance to do so , until now . \nthe film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . \nit has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . \nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \nwhen he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away . \ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \nthe three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail . \nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool . \nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \nbut ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs . \nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' . \nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \nthe trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \nbringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream . \nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \nmany of the studio's old men had retired or died . \ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features . \nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \nthe failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation . \nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \nthe people who had seen the film didn't think so . \nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't . \nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all . \nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film . \nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \nthis doesn't seem like all of the above . \ninstead , it's a classic in its own right . \nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \nthere's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero . \nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \nthere's a likeable character here ! \nnot that he's the only likeable character in the film . \nthere's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first . \nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be . \nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \nelmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \neven though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \nthat better chance has finally come . \nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney's most proudest achievements . \ni can't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ? \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really

called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \nit's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the

amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \ni don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the

certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy

, scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \nmurron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \nhowever , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be . \nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \ndavid o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \ncatherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \n", "category":

there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . \" \n ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) \nthe film began . . . . \nthe film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett . \nhe loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon . \n ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . ) \nthey continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . \nbrackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . \nthe wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . \nkline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't . \nthe whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . \nhis closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . \nthere are some genuinely

out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . \nthe movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . \nkline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . \nif you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending . \n . . . instead of saying \" i do \" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says \" i'm gay . \" \nthis is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart . \nmost of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy . \nit reminded me of the \" effeminate heterosexual \" sketch from saturday night live . \nit was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so . \nhowever , after the wedding , the film drags on . \nthey should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done . \nhe reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him . \nthere are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless . \nfinally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . \nthe preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , \" he's gay . \" \nit got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . \nby the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . \n ( much like this review you are saying ) \noverall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets . \nsee it in economy time . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . \nwall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . \ncritics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . \ni'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . \ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . \nstone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . \nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . \nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . \nit's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . \ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \nand not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \nmaybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap . \nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching . \nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces . \nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \nhe's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \nhis job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \nit's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers . \naffleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance . \naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \nthey aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \ni know this story . \nwe all do . \nbut it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\ director ben younger tells it . \nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \nhis style is sitcom bland . \nbut his writing isn't . \nyounger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \nthe brokers \\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one . \nwith the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat . \nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor . \ndiesl shines in his minor role . \nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's . \nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have . \nnia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \nat one point he says to her \" i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love \" . \nit's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \nit's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \nthat message being , \" greed is bad \" . \nyes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \nboiler room offers neither extreme . \nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "various films seen at the seattle film festival : \nit's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles \na recently

brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \nimpressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians .

interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . \nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" . \nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . \nstill , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . \na c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . \nthe pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza \nthis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . \nit tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . \nperhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . \nnor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . \nas you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . \nnot that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . \nall the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . \nboy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? \nadd onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari

east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . \nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . \nafter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . \nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . \nstill , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . \nc -- $2 . 50 . \nthe right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \nthese people like jerry lewis . \n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching . \n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \nit's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \nlots and lots of horses . \nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . \ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless

office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber . \nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the \" home alone \" name as well . \nthe result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \nhe's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \nthis time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school . \nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day . \nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \nit's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it . \nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \nthe movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \nthese are far worse . \nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \nif it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ? \nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \nit's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill . \nbut , because this is a \" family film , \" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive . \nit's an exercise in tediousness , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) . \ni can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \nmaybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . \nthe original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \nit's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the \" blair witch hunt , \" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \nhow did i know ? \nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained . \nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events . \nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \nooh . \nspooky . \nthe team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \nwacky hijinks ensue . \ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \nnevermind . ) \nthis movie was awful . \nsimply awful . \nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \nbecause she's pregnant ! \nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of \" deliverance \" ! \nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \nit didn't work . \non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \n ( \" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \nlet's get on a plane home . \" \n \" no . \ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . \" \n \" ok . \" ) \nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \ni also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film . \nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \nthis movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no \" monster , \" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \nhm ? ) \nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \nfrom the poorly-written

birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . \nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \nin little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \nafter all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \nmovies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \nyou'll see . \nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \nbut what has he become ? \na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \ndoesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \nbut let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . \nalthough it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \ni'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . \ngo see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * *

heels of such stalker fare as \" kiss the girls \" and \" i know what you did last summer . \" \nbut \" switchback \" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . \n \" switchback \" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching . \nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . \nhe is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit . \nlacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked

the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . \nin a sense , that's half of the basic problem with \" switchback . \" \nfor its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . \nbut \" switchback \" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . \nsome of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . \nwhat is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? \nand dennis quaid ? \n ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) \nermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in \" my so-called life \" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . \n>from a material standpoint , \" switchback \" is pretty empty . \nbut even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote \" the fugitive \" and \" die hard \" ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . \nthe set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . \nstill , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold . \n", "category":

battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance . \npolitical considerations aside ,

) . \nin the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what

considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame . \nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents . \nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of \" boogie nights \" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow

straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia . \namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at

) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \nthe tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \ni wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \njust because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn't . \nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \nsince none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \nunger , who made an impression in 1997's \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \nin the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \nand guess what ? \nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \n \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like

will have you dazzled for days ! \" \n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \ni'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \nbeing mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \nand i like it ! \nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \nsure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? \nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \nthere will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \nit's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \nwrong . \nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way . \nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \nthere's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \nhe's heading the class discussion . \nthere's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex . . . \n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' . \n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \nray asks . \n \" not gettin' any ! \" \none student responds . \nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \nand so , wild things sets into motion . \nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances . \nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \nsurprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot . \nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \nand what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them . \nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing . \ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch . \nit's good trash , in a sense . \none , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \nthis varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . . \nit's not as graphic as you might think ) . \nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene . \nit's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \nand , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \nand judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \nand then there is bill murray . \nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking . \nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures .

hands . \none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \nand i can't stress it

would be \" fluff . \" \nhowever , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . \n ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad . ) \nstory : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in .

the middle . \nacting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important . \nhowever , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more \" canadian \" type of mode . ) \ncarvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . \ntia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . \nlowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . \nwithout a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . \ndirection : spheeris is a classic \" music \"

fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \nit's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain't evil . \nit's just sad . \" \nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone . \nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it . \nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film . \nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \nthe most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey . \nit's been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if \nshe was strictly an actress . \nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \nemotion . \nsadness . \nstrength . \nwatching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \nshe makes it real . \nthat's not to say this is a perfect film . \nin fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \nwhile oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \nit doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point . \nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \njonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \nthere's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \neveryone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded . \nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \nact like a baby . \nthrow things . \nstumble around . \nchew food with your mouth open . \ni do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end . \nit's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \nit's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can't say that i

of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring . \nparents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , \" the wizard of oz . \" \nthat is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , \" the rugrats movie , \" is completely missing . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": " \" you can't have any of this . \nit's all mine ! \" \n--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested . \nan evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him . \nfor kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered . \nwhen something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped . \nthey enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm . \nher mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . \nthe king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . \nduring the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . \nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . \nin this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . \nafter each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's . \nbecause of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . \nas alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . \nif there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . \nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . \nthis film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . \nif there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone . \ncompelling , but ultimately not . \nthe opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . \nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence . \nwhen the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . \nat least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . \nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . \nfor some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . \none over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . \nwhy would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of \" rednecks \" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? \nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \ni haven't had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \nburton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \nhe doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "the \" italian hitchcock \" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena . \nthis time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects . \nsent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school's population terrified

big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex-rolling stone bill wyman , and argento's favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin . \nbut it gels

people went in droves to see this movie . \nnow before you go assuming i'm some sort of high brow snob , who can't appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \ni thought there's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \nit's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \nthe team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \nyou can figure out the rest from here . \nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \nfairuza balk plays sandler's leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a \" coaching for dummies \" -style book to help him get through games . \nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler's overprotective and overbearing mama . \neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \nwhich is sad , because i can't really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \nit's obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \nit's just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . \nboth films glamorize \" outlaws , \" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . \nboth relate the story of a couple liberated by love . \nbut where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . \nwhere bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . \nwhat bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . \nwhat bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . \nto examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . \nfor the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . \nthis mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . \nbrahma created . \nvishnu preserved . \nand siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . \nthe following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . \nyour plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . \ni think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . \nmuslims kill christians . \nhindus kill muslims . \nchristians kill pagans . \njews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . \nreligion is an orgy of killing . \nthe institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . \n \" the state is the divine idea upon earth , \" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . \nwell , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? \nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \nwe can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \nwho else has found it ? --the \nman of today ? -- \" i \ndon't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \nfor example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \nlet me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \nit's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \nas the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory . \nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \nthe style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \nthese can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \nat the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \nthe two of course go hand in hand . \nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \nscagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth . \nthe indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life . \nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn . \" \nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \nmickey : how ya feelin' ? \nwayne : fucking great ! \nmickey : you got the feelin' ? \nwayne : i'm alive . \ni'm alive for the first fuckin' time ! \nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \nhe got the feeling and he couldn't contain himself . \nwhat a feeling . \nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \ngo figure it out . \ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \n", "category":

presumable source of his powers as related in the narration . \nwearing what appears to be alice cooper's leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner . \nbut no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman . \n ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though . \n : ) \na nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life . \nhis two \" best \" set-pieces--

performance that owes as much to presence as ability . \nwhen the echo of that gunshot finally fades , watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience . \ndespite a healthy dose

heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) . \nother than that , it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . \nit's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . \nthat , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . \nthe punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . \nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . \nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . \ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . \ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . \nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . \nif only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . \nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . \ndirector simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . \nit's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . \ncharacters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . \nwest just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . \nhe even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . \nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . \nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . \nthere's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . \nindeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : \" shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? \" ) . \neven the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . \ngoldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . \ndialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . \nit's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . \nby the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . \nit's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . \ngoldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . \n", "category": "neg"},

part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . \ni was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . \nsometimes i even find myself up at

likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . \nrarely has a movie left me with such an

totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . \ncan something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? \nright from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . \nin the opening scenes , each

audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( \" oh , hi penny ! \nis brain with you ? \" ) . \ncreating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . \nthe \" plot \" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . \nmatthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , \na

dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . \nto be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to

technology available -- technicolor . \ntitanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . \ngwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy . \nthey both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . \nok , maybe that's not enough parallels . \nso titanic's not in gwtw's league . \nno matter . \ntitanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . \nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . \nthe money was obviously well-spent . \nthe costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . \ni especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . \nbut writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects . \ncameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . \nhe succeeds masterfully . \ncameron does two things that work incredibly well . \nfirst , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just \" titanic \" , not \" the titanic \" , mind you ) . \nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . \ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . \nstuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . \nsecondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . \nthe way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . \ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . \nthe supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in . \n ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . ) \nthe love story itself is rather conventional . \ni think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . \nthe performances are the key here . \nzane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . \nhe's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible . \nat the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not \" can i save this little girl ? \" , \nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \ndicaprio is a revelation . \ni hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really . \n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him . \nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \nwinslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \nat first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \nwe know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \nit's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive . \nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \ncameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "having not seen , \"

lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \nhowever zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \narlo is not happy with his job . \nhe is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \nand they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess

less sympathetic . \nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior . \nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \nhowever , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \nthat's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film . \nin fact , some

fascinating as many of sherlock's own . \nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \nzero effect works well during its

development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment . \nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \nbill

movies . \nat least this third entry realises it ; whereas \" the lost world \" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , \" jurassic park iii \" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin . \nthere is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or

installment more suitable for children . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life . \nthe script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say . \nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \nwill's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \nwill's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character . \nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . \nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being

by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . \nand , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . \nscream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously . \nthe success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . \nthe unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . \na sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . \nas stipulated by one of the \" rules of sequels \" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . \nparadoxically , there's a lot less gore . \nthere is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . \ncraven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . \na second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . \nafter all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . \nscream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . \nas in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue . \nthis time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the \" true life \" events of scream ) . \nsome of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . \nshortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . \ncraven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the \" movie within a movie \" sequences . \nthey give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . \nstab features heather graham in the \" casey becker \" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as \" sidney prescott \" ( neve campbell ) . \nsadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . \nit would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . \nfollowing the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . \nher friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . \nonce the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . \nat the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . \nshe has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . \nalso arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . \nin addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . \nthere's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . \nultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . \nfrom the stab scenes to lines like \" brothers don't last long in situations like this , \" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . \ntheir resolution to the obligatory \" whodunit ? \" \nis less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . \n ( \" nice twist , \" quips the killer . \n \" didn't see it coming , didya ? \" ) \none senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . \nsupposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case

nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \ngovernor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend ,

atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) . \nprimary colors' chief problem is its length . \nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \nthe scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \nthe extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \nit's a funny , and at some times shocking ,

popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm ! \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "part one of \" the strangest

, and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . \nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . \nbut it sure is a fascinating failure . \nmarky . \n . \n . \ner , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . \nhe's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . \nhe works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . \nthey're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . \nthey all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . \nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . \nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . \nwhen they do this , it turns out she is paris' . \n . \n . \ngoddaughter ! \nit's very bad to have paris against you . \nthe story is standard action film stuff . \nit's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \nit's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \nlike i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . \nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . \nand since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \nthey're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . \nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \nit's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "the caveman's valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green , based on his

//filmfreakcentral . net \n| now with search engine * * * \na strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder . \nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn . \nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \nthat being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \nit , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \nreaders of sam keith's brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "making his directorial debut , actor jon favreau brings along his swingers co-star , vince vaughn , for this tale of two mugs on a career

have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as \" raising arizona \" and \" the hudsucker proxy , \" made their feature film debut with \" blood simple , \" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \nit bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent \" fargo , \" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; \" blood simple \" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \nthe premise of \" blood simple \" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \nemmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the \" big picture \" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \nthis aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \nthe coens might have done well to title the film \" fear and loathing in texas . \" \nsome have labeled \" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \nthat said , \" blood simple \" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \nthat said , \" blood simple \" is not exactly flawless . \nfor one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \nand although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \n \" blood simple \" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \ni would firmly recommend it to all \" coen-heads \" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "i was anxious to see this for a long time . \na friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is . \nhe proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . \nscream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , \" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . \" \nit's very familar , your typical horror film . \nso why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? \nbecause it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . \nthis raises another question : how does it do this ? \nsimple : the characters . \nthey're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette . \nthey are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times . \nyou can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed . \nshe knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , \" what door am i at ? \" \nand that gets her killed . \nthat scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen . \nthe plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis . \nbut as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing . \nthat and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , \" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . \" \nwhich is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . \nthe cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . \nalso good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( \" the fonz \" ) as the school principal . \ni took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance . \ni hate that show , i hate those actors . \nthey're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , \" dangerous liaisons for kids ! \" \nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . \nimagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . \nand i was impressed . \nin fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . \nit's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . \ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . \ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . \ni also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . \nphillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . \nwow . \nisn't that a memorable name ? \ni could just say it over and over again . \nsebastian valmont . \nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . \nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . \nthe ones who do are irritating . \nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \nbut it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \nbut -- dear god ! \n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \nbut i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \nand there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . \nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \nthe film fails in every other way , too . \nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . \ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \nso , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? \ntitillation , of course . \nit can't even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . \nit's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \nbut kids don't act like this . \nnobody acts like this . \nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound . \ni'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful . \n", "category":

mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . \nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper . \nfrom this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . \nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . \nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . \nthe jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . \nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . \ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . \nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . \ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . \nwhether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . \nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . \nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . \nsecondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . \nthroughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . \nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . \nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . \nafter the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . \nsurprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . \nin this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self . \nupon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . \nany child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . \non the technical side , shrek triumphs . \ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . \nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . \nmyers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . \nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . \ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . \nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . \nschulman . \nthe script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . \ncapping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . \nwith shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . \nthe smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . \na film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . \n", "category": "pos"},

miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting . \nlynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling . \nthe film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) . \nfrom this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping . \nthe plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing . \nmaclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in

these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots . \nlynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion . \ninstead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times . \nlynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine . \nhowever , for fans of odd difficult indies , \" blue velvet \" could be just what they are looking for . \nit is very hard to discuss \" blue velvet \" without discussing

\nlaura dern was consistently annoying . \nbut dennis hopper stole every scene he was in . \nhis evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his

role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \na timeless epic it is not . \nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \nalmost too 90's , it seems . \nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry

eating gilbert grape ? \nis such a film . \nit's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \nas the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel . \nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . \none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \nit's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , \" i knew someone like that once . \" \ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , \" we're not going anywhere , \" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard . \njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \ndepp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters . \nonly juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \n",

seemed like the perfect concept . \nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \nit's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \njim carrey's signed on too ? \neven better . \nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . \nit's not for lack of trying . \nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \nsoon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \nthis guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \nsome have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . \nthey're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's \" there's something about mary . \" \n ( 1999's \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \nthe brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \nbut they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . \n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \nyeah , me too . ) \nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . \nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \nbut by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . \nthat's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . \nthis doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \nit's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \ncarrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . \nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \nzellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . \nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \nbut i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . \neven after that happens , though , i'll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "for \" original sin , \" the road to the screen has been rocky . \ninitially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing

attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to

, so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch . \ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .

the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \nit feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \nwe see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \nand yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . \nas such

reluctant julie assist her . \nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into \" vylette \" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \nhowever , an investigation

insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \ncourtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \nfern's rise to popularity is equally lame . \nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \nit's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \nit at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense . \nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the

. \nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \n-------------------- \" fail-safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side . \nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \nthis is the theme of sidney lumet's \" fail-safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \n \" fail-safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \na great deal of \" fail-safe \" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost . \nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \nthe events in \" fail-safe \" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail-safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it . \nmost of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \nmany of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \n \" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" \na guest asks impatiently . \n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele's \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories

and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . \nthe project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \nshe's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . \none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses . \nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \nthere are probably too many characters . \nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . \nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \nthe stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \nthere isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't \" do much \" for me . \non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \nfinn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . \nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \nif there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "wyatt earp details thirty-five years in the

, but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . \nthe selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . \nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . \nin the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . \nanimated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . \nlet me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off .

more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . \ndanny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . \nyou can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . \nthe movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments . \nthe script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life . \ndemille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . \nat less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . \nwe meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . \nwe watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . \nmoses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . \n ( \" all i've ever known to be true is a lie , \" moses complains . ) \nafter finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . \nafter leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go . \nthis leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . \nit is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . \ndrawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . \nthe construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . \nthe most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . \ndone with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . \neven though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . \nthis awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . \nthe prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . \nit is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . \nhow old a kid would need to be to

discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . \nthe police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . \nat the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . \nthat's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . \ndeceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . \nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \nit's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . \nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \npolice procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . \nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . \nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \nas wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . \nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . \nboth play their characters like familiar types . \npenn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . \nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \nrenee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . \none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \nplot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . \nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "as any sociologist will

by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it's a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has

won an oscar ) , \" carlito's way \" was destined for underrated heaven . \nthat's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . \nand what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \n \" carlito's way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . \nof course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart . \ncarlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not . \ncarlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . \nwhen he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . \nhe's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . \ncarlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding . \nbeing a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . \nand the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . \nhe gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . \non the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . \nshe's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \nsure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \nwhat's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \nlike \" apollo 13 , \" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \nit's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \nhis earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) . \nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as \" strong \" as his oscar-winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" \nwell , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \nin \" carlito's way , \" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \nand they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \nevery scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \n \" carlito's way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you're absolutely blown away . \nit's a wonderful film , a highly underrated

species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . \nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in

pupils to dilate once he's infected . \nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's \" black cancer \" to me . \nbut that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . \nspecies was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did . \nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . \na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? \naliens sans flamethrowers . \nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . \nafter the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . \nhowever , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . \nat one point she's called on to play alien \" empath \" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell . \nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . \nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . \none problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . \nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . \nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i'm gonna get african on someone's ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? \nbut species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start . \nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all ,

movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that

an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is

to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . \nbruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . \nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . \nfollowed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . \nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . \nthe disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . \nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell . \ncampbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . \nsuch informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . \nalso , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . \nfor that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . \nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became \" confused \" and were unable to perform the scene . \ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . \nthe two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . \ndon't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . \nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask \" have anything to say sam ? \" \nto me , that's not a good sign . \nalso , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . \nwell , compared to rob and bruce anyway . \nalso included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's \" gala \" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . \nthis raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . \noverall , the evil dead is a good low

blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . \ncertain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . \ni chuckled incessantly , all the way home . \nlet me share . \nthe skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . \nluke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . \ndespite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . \nsoon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . \nyeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? \nbut luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . \nthe premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . \nunfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . \nit's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . \nbut not the script . \n`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . \nfirst off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . \nafterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . \nwill they never take this watch off ? \nand what if they forget it by their bedside ? \nperhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . \non top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . \ngee , why not member t-shirts ? \nbut my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions . \nthey are given official skull paddles . \nwhen flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . \nfacing the opposite way means a disagreement . \nwouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? \nhell no . \nthey have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . \ni'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . \nthe cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . \nbut not entirely . \naccomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . \nand then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . \nmcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . \ni pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors . \nthe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . \nlet's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . \npaul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son . \nwalker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) . \nsome actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . \nit really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . \nor maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . \nit makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . \naside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls' gets little accomplished . \nthe thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . \nthe story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . \ninstead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . \nwe've seen it all before , and better . \n`the skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ?

\nthere are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after \" ink \" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan . \nand of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available ) . \nthat's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . \nsaving private ryan is worth your time , but it's definitely no schindler's list . \nthe battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't . \nthe movie's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , \" tell me i've led a good life . \ntell me i'm a good man . \" \nspielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . \nmuch more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker . \nthis while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . \nby not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . \nand even if it's not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . \ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . \never since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . \nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . \nfrank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . .

) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . \nand finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . \ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \ndoes `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? \nonly occasionally . \nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . \nthose expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . \n`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . \nschrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . \nthe exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . \ngoodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . \nwatch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . \n`bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . \nscorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but

disgust from the others . \nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either . \nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . \nas a 30-year-old , fred hasn't

you more , but this guy is even less funny . \nwhy ? \nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . \nclassic comedic

him in all his anti-glory . \nas for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . \nthis is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . \ngiving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times . \nthe amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! \ni must admit that it gave

aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them . \nsadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right . \na two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? \nand saying that a

film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true . \ncontrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \nit's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . \nbut one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( \" wings \" ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : \" men in black , \" \" a life less ordinary \" . . . ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . \nfortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life . \nsince vincent looks a bit like him . . . \nafter a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . \nthere , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are . \nhowever , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers . \nwe know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is . \nhowever , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . \nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . \nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . \nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . \nirene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . \nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . \nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind . \nthe production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . \nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . \nand the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . \nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . \nthe acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . \nbut the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . \ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of . \n \" gattaca \" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we'll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . \nand when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual

the dead paris . \ncomments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . \nboth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . \ninterestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively

been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . \nvirtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . \nthe film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . \nmany important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . \nthe cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . \njeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . \ncarrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . \nmeschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either . \nvirtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . \nin other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch . \nthe movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . \nthis turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either . \ndon't be seduced into watching this movie

who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \nthis movie stinks out loud . \nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \nso i'm giving it a . \nand maybe that is too generous . \nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \nso what is this movie about ? \nyou ask . \nlike it really matters . \nok , here goes . \nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \ni don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \ni've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \nthen we have the cast . \nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \nsadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . \nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . \nmeyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \nhey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . \nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \ni sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . \nbut hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \nan even better idea might be to require video

to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . \nand it should have been . \nthis is basically a rehash of \" the stepford wives , \" the great 70s film i never saw

when they get horny , they become homicidal . \nisn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? \nthe film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson's creek \" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension . \nin the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't . \ngavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . \nhere , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . \nthe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but \nreally , we don't care anyway . \ni probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for \" the x-files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . \nlike the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . \nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . \nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . \nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there . \ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . \nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . \nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . \nif he's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? \nthe film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . \nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these ,

impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . \nthe theory in this film is based on the graphic novel \" from hell \" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? \nyes , the brothers even managed to slip a little \" love \" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . \nthat's right , there's no real need to put any \" romance \" in a film about a mass murderer ! \nbut that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . \nsure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . \ni was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't ) . \non the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . \nbut then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . \ni mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc . . . \nin fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters . . . or \nam i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? \nperhaps . \noverall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . \nbut it's not for everyone . \nsome may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . \nbut i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! \nand god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the

terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz

popular of koontz's books . \nthe idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in

rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat's another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few

a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film . \nsee , spoofs are easy with me . \ni love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love . \nsometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing . \nsometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter ) . \nsometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film . \nabraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me . \nit's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything . \nthere may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness . \ni enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking . \nmost lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense . \nmafia ! \nhas no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh . \nthe film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino . \nour hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . \nto describe the story of mafia ! \nis absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout . \nalong the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing . \nmovies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction . \nabrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! \nto his experience . \nhe takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) . \nthe actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film . \nmohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here . \nhe looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) . \nhe's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material . \nlloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone . \nthe hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific . \nunfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! \nthat i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh . \nbut that's a good sign : mafia ! \nis so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory . \ni laughed so hard that it shut off my brain . \ni know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . \nfinally , a film that does this for me . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "i won\u0012t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . \ni saw glimpses of

not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day\u0012s work . \ni didn\u0012t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing \u0016 but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . \nsigourney

would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . \nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . \nthey ( yawn ) were wrong . \nit doesn\u0012t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth . \nthere\u0012s a little saying that goes something like this : \u0013if you\u0012re going to make a bad film , do it well . \u0014 \ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . \nalien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . \nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot . \nin one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . \nanother one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . \nfair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . \nif you think i\u0012m struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . \none exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . \nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . \nso in a film where the one liners come as bad as \u0013earth man , what a shit hole\u0014 and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . \noh , and in case you\u0012re wondering about my bag of lollies \u0016 the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . \nso all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still

believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . \neighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . \nthank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . \nhis images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter

technological \" geek \" side . \nby the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . \nthis movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . \nhowever , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . \nhadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . \nhurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . \nthis one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . \nthis is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . \nfoster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . \nearly scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . \nthe movie's pacing is very good and subtle . \nthe panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . \nthe politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . \none of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . \nthere were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . \nit is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . \neverything else was very one-sided ( e . g . \nfoster ) . \nlowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . \nthe core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . \nit feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . \nin another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . \nthe concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . \nbut the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . \nfreed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . \nas the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . \nit is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably

relationships . \njakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . \nevery scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . \nit is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . \ndirector peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . \nthere are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . \njakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . \nand after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . \nsometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . \ni saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . \nsurprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . \nbut by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . \ntime alone will make that call . \nbut by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side . \nwe were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . \nthat we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . \nthe truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . \nunless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . \ncarrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town . \ntruman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . \nthere is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . \nbut then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . \nthis curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program . \nwhat makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . \nthe soundstage , we're told , is \" only the second man-made structure visible from space . \" \ntruman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . \nweir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky . \nthe second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . \nhis best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . \nhis wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . \nhe sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . \none wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : \" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . \" \nnevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . \nthis convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . \nby underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . \nthere is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , \" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . \" \nbut that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . \nthe abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side . \nthe truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? \nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \nwhat does god really think of us ? \ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be . \nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \n", "category":

receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "eric rohmer's \" pauline at the beach , \" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign

film . \nbut if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \nwe've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor . \nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son . \ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments . \nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to

enjoyable . \nwith all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . \nstill , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . \nagreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . \nperiod . \nrazor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . \nthe film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . \nbut aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions . \nthat is , unless that is intentional . \nrazor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . \nyou can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . \nyou'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . \nyou'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . \nand then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . \nthe film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story . \nbut in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . \nas much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . \nalmost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards

viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . \nor more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . \nthis is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor \u0016 but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . \nif a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . \nalthough gere\u0012s performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect \u0016 and i look forward to seeing him star with other

telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . \nbut what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place \u0016 perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . \nif you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . \nit is upon the film\u0012s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . \nif that wasn\u0012t bad enough , red corner\u0012s dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . \nshen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . \ntaking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . \nalthough it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the film\u0012s main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story

spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \nthat film is amistad . \nalthough not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \nwatching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise . \nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force . \non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \nthe first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause . \ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success . \nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \namistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \nfinally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain . \nschindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \nthere is no such figure in amistad . \nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \nit is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \namistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "you don't have to know poker to like \" rounders , \" but it might help .

far behind . \nthings change , however , when mike's old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . \nthat \" rounders \" ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency . \ndirector john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs \" red rock west \" and \" the last seduction , \" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . \ndamon and norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be worth catching even if \" rounders \" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . \nany sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . \nif only the other character interaction was as

by the same limited screen time . \nand as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for \" rounders \" ' moral . \nthat moral , by the way , is \" our destiny chooses us , \" and it's something of a surprise when \" rounders \" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . \nin the end , \" rounders \" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . \nthe road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . \nhere , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren't cut out for the cards . \nscreenwriters david levien and brian koppelman

\nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement

stunning visually . \nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator ,

prisons . \nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down

it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix

the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with . \nwhen the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as \" barbecue , \" it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end . \n \" the whole nine yards \" is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects . \nrosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who's married to matthew perry's none-too-successful dentist . \nit's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust . \nthen there's natasha henstridge ( \" species \" i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis . \nshe gets involved with perry's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door . \nhenstridge and perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together . \nperry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up . \nmost objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals . \npeet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off . \nwhen \" my cousin vinny \" is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as \" clue , \" \" greedy , \" and \" sgt . \nbilko , \" you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path . \nperry's pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a

pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities . \n ( don't

relationship . \nwho ya gonna believe ? \ndespite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . \nher brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear \" cute \" to her adoring fans . \nbeing loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile

to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . \n ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) \nthere are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy . \nthe premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it's enough

rubber shark attached to his leg \ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \nby ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \nthe villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \nakiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \nit makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \njoel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode . \nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \nmr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \ni think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted \" bomb ! \" \neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \nmr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" \nin the least inventive way . \ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \nchris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \nthe film's one saving grace ? \nundoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \nms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \n ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . ) \nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers . \ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go . \nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to

that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous

that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe . \neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \nthe script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously . \nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \neverything is ugly and dark . \nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries

holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \ni don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating . \n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \n4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables . \n5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? \nif so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . \n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot . \n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel . \n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \n11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \ndon't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america's funniest home videos \" . \nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \nthe only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \nnow , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park

the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \nis brilliant . \nmars attacks ! \nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \nbut unlike independence day , which

developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \nit's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united

, pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up

"neg"}, {"text": " ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \nfor starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . \nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects ) . \nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \nits easy to see why . \nthe world doesn't make sense . \n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? \nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \nhowever , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \nbut if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \nseven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . \nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \nhe's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \nin his mind he didn't kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \nreally , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \nbut then again , its a cruel world . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \nit's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past . \nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk . \nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \nit starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten . \nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \ntopol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \ni felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \nunless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \n",

flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and

killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe're so relieved when justice is served .

was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . \nwhat they have ignored is actually a great picture . \nwoody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . \nand he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . \nthe latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . \nedward norton plays their jerky lawyer . \nthe relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . \ngod's damnation . \nbut in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . \nfriedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . \nto go beyond good and evil . \nthis is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . \nbecause it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . \nbut i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . \nthere are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . \nthis movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . \n", "category":

everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) \nwithout benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . \nbeing an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word \" suck \" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) \ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) \nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . \nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . \nsadly , that did not occur . \nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original \" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . \nin moore's case , the film would have been helped if \" the x- files \" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! \nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! \nmortensen ( who i liked in \" g . i . \njane \" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . \nsam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that's about it . \nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . \nanne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . \nat least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can't be said for most of the rest of the cast . \nthe best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama's boy , norman bates . \nhe's not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . \nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . \nthere is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . \nvan sant has made a boring film . \nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren't as eye-catching now . \nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don't impress or excite . \nvan sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) \nthese images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . \ndefinitely not hitchcock's intention ! \nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann's original famous and terrific score . \nif a film like \" psycho \" does not frighten , then what's the point . \naside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . \nthere are things van

director . \nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( \" the client \" and \" a time to kill \" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential , the publicity for his latest release , \" 8mm , \" raised new hope . \nit promised to be something unusual . \nit wasn't . \nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband's belongings . \nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher's \" batman & robin \" ) . \nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl's name and tracks her to los angeles . \nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader's \" hardcore , \" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \nboth films are modeled on dante's \" the inferno , \" of course ; \" 8mm \" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \n \" hardcore \" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \n \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \nin its better moments it's an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he's reading truman capote's \" in cold blood \" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \n \" in cold blood \" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , \" dance with the devil and the devil don't change ; the devil changes you . \" \ntom does change-i'll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . \nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn't have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn't come back . \n ( walker's \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . \ncage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn't give him enough to work with . \nphoenix walks away with the movie-he's smart , charming , and funny . \nother cast members include \" fargo \" 's peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" 's james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . \nin the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . \nhowever , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year's \" twilight , \" for example- \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing

on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! \nfirst thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? \nwell , yes ? and no . \nit's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems . \nwhen i saw the first trailer for \" titanic \" , it was when i went to see \" bean \" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \ni mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect . \nit's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \ni didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much . \ndid i ? yes and no . \nmainly yes , i'm happy to say . \nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! \n : - ) ) . \nwell , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \ndoes it work here ? \nin script form it doesn't add all that much to the story . \nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \nit's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \nit's engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \nthere's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending . \nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \nwe all knew it was coming . \ni'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \nand it is an hour . \nmy goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? \ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \nbut i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \nnot that i'd expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \nis it overdone ? \ni thought so . \nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half . \nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \nyou really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \nthe bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \nso , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \nhaven't mentioned the script . \nplot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything . \nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \nit's a period drama . \nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \nback in the turn of the century ? \ni doubt it . \nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \ni doubt it . \nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \nyes it is . \na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \nstick with directing , dude . \nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? ! \nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \ni haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score . \nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \n ; - ) \ni've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \nhell , don't talk to me about oscars . \nbloomin' farce . \nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \nnope , i don't think so . \nit's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \nand as for the fact they're reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you ! \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \nhis entrance ,

; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother . \njill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn't happy ! \" \nand \" joe isn't safe here ! \" \n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \ni don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close . \nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \nit's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \nbut adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \nnobody ever figures out what

growing up . \" \nwell , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . \nat least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser . \nfresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . \nas usual nothing goes right until the last reel . \nbut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . \nand american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . \nfor the most part , they are not shown as individuals . \nthey are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . \nit is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program . \ndespite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . \nmost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . \nalso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . \nit is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . \nthe first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . \nthe sequel is more cynical . \nit knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . \nthe only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . \nin the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . \namerican pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . \nit is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . \namerican pie 2 is funny , but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown . \n",

followed by \" scream 2 , \" \" urban legend , \" and the original , \" i know what you did last summer , \" a film like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" was bound to be made sooner or late . \nit is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . \nit has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . \nsince then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . \nwhen julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up . \nwhen they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . \nof course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . \nit is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" is made . \ni am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to \" ikwydls , \" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a \" friday the 13th \" movie . \nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , \" i still know . . . \" \nhas no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . \nalso gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . \nwhile i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . \nthey were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . \nanother element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . \nsince so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . \nalso of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn't even have fun at that , like i did in the \" scream \" movies and , \" urban legend . \" \nit figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . \nmaybe the people who made , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . \nthe ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead . \n", "category":

\" spawn \" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how \" men are the ones who create evil on earth . \" \nso much for a message . \nthe movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . \nsimmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . \nof course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . \nsweeney ) . \nhis , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's . \nclown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . \nwynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that \" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . \" \nphew . got all that ? \nit would be easy to dismiss \" spawn \" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level . \nthe computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . \nthe several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . \nother elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image . \nin movies like \" contact , \" the special effects serve the story . \nin \" spawn , \" they are the story . \nand spawn himself isn't even an interesting character . \nthe film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . \nwhat we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . \neven watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . \npoor leguizamo . \nhe starred in february's \" the pest , \" a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . \nas clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . \nleguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . \nthe guy was brilliant in \" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! \njulie newmar . \" \nwhat is he doing wasting his talent in this and \" the pest \" ? \ni'm one of the few people that liked \" batman & robin , \" this summer's other big-budget comic book film . \nyet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of \" batman \" as the superior adaptation . \nthere's a compelling story somewhere in \" spawn \" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here . \nas it is , \" spawn \" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . \n", "category":

as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- \" palmetto \" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming . \nit's not a classic by

\nand i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . \nusually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign . \nwaiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event . \nthe play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this \" mockumentary \" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success . \nteaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others . \neverybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out . \nthese characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are . \nalthough levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! \nif there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it . \nsome humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros . \nas delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous . \nthankfully , just as your about to say \" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom \" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . \nlike a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) . \nlike i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach . \nyou can't really watch these people and not think they're real people ! \neven they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary . \nand even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful ! \nas a word of note , despite it's \" r \" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean . \nthis rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words . \neven if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way . \nit's actually quite humorous and tastefully done ! \nit might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman . \nit's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it . \nit's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film

portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nmilos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs . \nlarry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \nthe film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky . \ncut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati . \nthe strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter . \nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history . \nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations . \nconsidering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs . \nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous . \nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity . \nthe film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs . \nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . \nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side . \nthere's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking . \nultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . \nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . \nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film . \ncourtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive . \nit's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \nthe people vs . \nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "eight years after its release ,

using my sony/loews critic's pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . \nit's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \nmike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \nhe never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \nit's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \ntechnically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid's \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them . \nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e . \nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals . \none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \nmatt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer . \nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved . \ncan someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \neverything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . \nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \n",

\n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \nif that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . \nthey've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \nmeanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \nthe film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \nthere's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n \" it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \ni'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \nearl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks . \nit seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day . \nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \nthere's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work . \ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \none minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . \none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \nted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . \nit's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \nactually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 . \nlike \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . \ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true . \nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \nmaybe they live in dick clark's pool house . \nanyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart . \nthe supporting performances are also good . \nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \nlin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \nlee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags . \nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \nit's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \nafter that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \nfortunately ,

packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller . \nand i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some

plausible answers . \nwe get the overly smart kid who manages to \" pull one \" over on the bad guys . \nwe get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy . \nwe get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot . \nand what about the film's main plot point ? \nwhy would the bad guys

or why not set up another heist instead ? ) . \ni'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why ! \nand many , many more . \nugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? \ni thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke . \nand a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions . \nbadly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise ,

regular guy \" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture . \nincidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ? \nshe was completely superfluous . \nand on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies ,

effectively improved upon . \nthis is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original . \nbut i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . \nyou see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection . \nbut what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ? \nthat is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad . \ni've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much . \nit has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access . \nobviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) . \nthe three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi . \nof the three , only danes has a real character . \nribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes . \nwhen the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations . \nall kinds of good stuff ! \nthe only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments . \nalthough ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance . \nepps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity . \nbut the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting . \na drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . \nclaire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . \nshe could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . \nepps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been . \nthe mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it . \nit's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time . \nnothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for . \nclaire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out . \nthere are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . \ndo not be fooled . \nsome may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "a

no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film . \nwhat impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . \nscreenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . \nno question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . \nfortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . \nthe film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . \njessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . \narriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . \nwhat happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho . \nit's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own . \nthough nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . \nwe meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . \nseveral more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive . \nthe english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . \nfortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . \nthe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . \nand the soundtrack ? \nit is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . \nas it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding . \napparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . \na stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience . \neven better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen . \nand the colours ! \ndeep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . \nthe cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . \na nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . \nthese kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . \nsuspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . \nthe gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . \n", "category": "pos"},

, as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . \nthe romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . \none of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . \nhowever , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . \nthis is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . \nthe father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara . \nshe does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . \n ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . \nrounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant . \nthe dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . \nif there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance . \nwhile she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . \nthe movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . \ndrew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . \nas well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . \nstill , this movie is one that will please many viewers . \nwith plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "if the 70's nostalgia didn't

_before_ last summer , and since \" i \" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it's really illogical to say that \" i \" _still_ know what \" you \" did _last_ summer . \nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter \" i still know , \" the longer \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" or the appropriate \" stupid people getting hacked to bits . \" \nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . \nfor example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? \nprobably not , but that's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights .

guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . \nyeah , right . \ntheir island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . \nhe sports the same gorton's fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he's still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . \nthough i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . \nin a sense , that's the movie's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . \nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway's derivative \" i still know \" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . \nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all ,

circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced

shrinking circle of friends . \nalthough the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . \nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \nirvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . \nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of

british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants .

. \nwhat we don't see might not be able to hurt us . \njust close your eyes and think of england . \nduring times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \nadapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake . \nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \nwhen grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape . \ngrace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \nthe duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \nthat's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . \nrohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \nit looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . \nwhy ? \nthey

the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \nthere's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except

warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . \nwhen the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and

the perspective of his enemies . \nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . \nalthough such elements of john millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . \nto be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film ,

adventure story of gatewood and his band . \nto make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . \nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . \nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \neven hill's

truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves . \nsure , it

excessive 90's terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be . \nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan

inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . \nthe other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . \nthere are only a few hundred people on

characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a

, and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a

the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side

running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition \nsynopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? \nbelieve it . \nsliding doors is a love 'what if' story . \nthe gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . \nin the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . \nso she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . \nhelen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . \nthe film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . \nin story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . \narriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nthis leads to a life where helen moves out . \nhelen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . \nin story two , helen experiences a different fate . \nshe misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity . \nin this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . \nwill the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? \nopinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . \nat last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . \nsliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . \nnot only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . \nwhen helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! \nnor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . \nnobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , \" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! \" \nwhen helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache . \nand handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . \ninstead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . \nanother example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . \nin other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . \nthere are minor inconveniences . \nsince sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . \ndistinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . \nbut in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing . \nalso , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . \nbut these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . \npossibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? \nsliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in . \nmonty python and the meaning of fate , anybody

turned out if the choice had been different . \nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \nmaybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . \nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . \" \nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn't just a plot device , either . \nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \nshe doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity . \njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \nit shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in . \npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \non another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \nbut it's not all in the dialogue . \nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \nfor those who are so inclined , its

teen angst \" film ( one of the slogans is \" teen is a four-letter word \" - hardy har har ) . \nit's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in \" scream \" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in \" independence day \" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who

three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . \nthe film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . \ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as \" easy rider , \" \" natural born killers , \" and \" kalifornia , \" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . \nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . \n \" the doom generation \" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . \nhe wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . \nhere's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . \namy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . \nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note . \nhe points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . \njordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . \nthe cash register rings up \" 6 . 66 \" \n ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) . \njordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car . \nhe asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . \nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . \nthey say they don't have it . \nhe gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . \nthe head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . \ni don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . \naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art . \nwrong . \nit takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . \nwhen george romero made \" dawn of the dead , \" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . \nsame goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory \" dead alive , \" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . \nit was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . \na scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . \nhere's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath

, and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . \nalso , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in \" caligula \" ) . \npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny

meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence . \notherwise defined as \" teen angst , \" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . \nlook , i'm 19 years old . \ni went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . \ni've since moved on to \" i don't really know what to do with my life \" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . \npart of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . \nit's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . \nthis is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them . \nit's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! \nwhat they really need is a reality check . \nthe world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . \nbut part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . \nthe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it . \nhence the title . \nnot only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . \neverything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . \nhow does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? \nhow does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? \nand why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? \nif araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are . \nand if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world . \nand if you still don't think that \" the doom generation \" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . \nrose macgowan is horrible . \nyes , she proved herself talented in \" scream , \" but she's so bad in \" the doom generation \" that if i had not seen her in \" scream , \" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . \nher entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable . \nequally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . \nhis performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in \" that thing you do ! \" \nand then there's james duval . \nlet's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . \nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him \" least talented actor in the world . \" \ni have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . \nor at least somewhere up there . \nhere's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , \" heresy \" ( example of the lines : \" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there \" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . \nthe film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says \" fuck . \" \nno explanation of this should be necessary . \nand finally , a note to gregg : grow up . \nreally . \nmove out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . \nand don't quit it . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i think of i know

\nsometimes they're not . \nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the

not really sure why . \nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \ni simply enjoyed the film . \ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "susan

two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has

direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it's over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the

downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . \nsince jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , \" what happens after you die ? \" \nor , \" how does it feel to be a snowman ? \" \nbut instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . \nthe performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . \nmichael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? \ni have always liked kelly preston . \nshe is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , \" nothing to lose , \" and , \" addicted to love . \" \njoseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . \nin one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . \nthis brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . \nsince i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . \nsome of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : \" you da man , \" says charlie . \n \" no , i da snowman , \" replies jack . \nor how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : \" snowdad is better than no dad . \" \ndo people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? \nthe snowman , created by john henson's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , \" jack frost , \" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . \neither way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . \nas a seasonal holiday picture , \" jack frost , \" is pretty much a clunker . \na better christmas film from this year is , \" i'll be home for christmas . \" \nbetter yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , \" it's a wonderful life , \" \" a christmas story , \" or , \" prancer . \" \n \" jack frost , \" is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . \ni doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .

heinlein , \" childhood's end \" by arthur c . clarke and \" man in the high castle \" and \" do androids dream of electric sheep \" by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth . \nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings . \nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . \nit really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel \" rocketship galileo \" and crafted the film \" destination moon \" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own . \nfrom there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . \nwith the release of touchstone pictures \" mission to mars \" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . \nthe film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . \nwoody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . \nentering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . \nluc consoles jim with woody's assistance . \nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . \nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . \nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . \nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . \ngoing out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' . \na strange noise emanates from the rock . \nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . \nback on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . \nluc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . \nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . \nmeteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface . \nthe big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . \nand if so , what is its relationship with us ? \nnow for the bad news . \nthe entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \nthe famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \nborrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava's \" planet of the vampires \" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole . \nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \nhe's just having too much fun here to give a damn . \nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \nsubtlety is non-existent here . \nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . \nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \nsadly it is not . \ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \nbut it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have

how original ) . \neven with all its special effects , action , and adventure this film is boring . \nnot a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot . \ndennis hopper completely

in a world in which females have no say . \nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \nthe emperor has called for a conscription , one man from

\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \ngriffith . \ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "this movie was one of

excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . \nfrom what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text": "the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \nso it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \nat his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives . \nbut , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \nthe strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter . \nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \n \" i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , \" he says . \nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him . \nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \nsonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \nit is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \nwatching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \nduvall knew that the power of the film's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn't need to be artificially enhanced . \nin this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text":

the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . \nhomage to such films as \" high noon \" ( obviously ) , \" red river \" and most notably \" butch cassidy & the sundance kid \" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . \nit is a comforting experience . \nat a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . \nhere is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . \nthis is the purest \" horse opera \" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne . \ndirector tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past . \nin this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . \nnothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action . \nand that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . \nand what of the action and stunts . \nwell , while not up to a level of \" drunken master 2 \" or any of jackie's hong kong films , \" shanghai noon \" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . \nhis timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . \njackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . \nfinally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . \nto sum up , \" shanghai noon \" is a fun summer confection . \nnot too heavy and not too light . \na fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . \nan enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "jacques tati's 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot's vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation . \nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going . \nin \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \ntati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he's not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one . \nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \n \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \nnote : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . \nit would at most receive a pg rating . \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . \nmercury rising adds to a

the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . \nbut the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . \nthis film wasn't well

\nwhen a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong . \nmurphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job . \nwith his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt . \nthen his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott ) . \nfinding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist . \nbut all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger . \nmetro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads . \nin the first place , korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up ) . \na reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies . \nworst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica . \nyou can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all . \nscott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three-dimensional character , and murphy is never able to reconcile the two . \nthe script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with . \nfor much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . \nmurphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply . \ni suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it . \nas vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation . \ncarter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ . \nthe fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling . \nan action film like

entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . \nall stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . \ntherefore , \" gone with the wind \" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . \nit's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . \nthe film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . \nthis plays a major factor in the film's success . \nto use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . \nit might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . \ncan a story set so long ago be relatable now ? \nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \nit doesn't simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \nwe're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \nhe isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense . \nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \nhe's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation . \nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \ndo we have food ? \ndo we have a navy ? \nall we have is tobacco . \" \nall true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong . \nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing . \nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her . \nbut scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \nnot my leg ! \ndon't cut off my leg ! \" \nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat . \nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \nall ? \nnone ? \neither way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \nit's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it's still a masterpiece for

stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders

, daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence .

( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \nred's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams . \nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight . \nfreddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \nit does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . \nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \nvincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \ni don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . \nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that . \n", "category": "neg"}, {"text":

. \nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \nbut there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . \nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \nportman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . \namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he's done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n \" his future is clouded . \" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n", "category": "pos"}, {"text": "from dusk till dawn

richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist . \nthey escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town . \nthey have

expectations must not have been high for \" great expectations \" -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . \nit's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . \n \" great expectations \" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's \" william shakespeare's romeo + juliet . \" \n \" great expectations \" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . \nthere's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . \nfinn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . \nflash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . \nthere , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . \nwhen estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \nbut she's not the only ghost from finn's past that's going to be paying him a visit . \ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups . \nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \npaltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire . \nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \nalfonso cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax . \nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren't familiar with the story . \ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \nand frankly , it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine's day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" ' seemingly average box office chances after all . \n", "category": "pos"}]
